🐍 When Python Indentation Goes Wrong: How Black Saved My Deployment

I was preparing to submit my AI Tutor project for certification when disaster struck. After a simple documentation update, my HuggingFace Space deployment failed with indentation errors.

The Problem:
- Bulk text editing operations had corrupted Python files by stripping indentation from docstrings and code blocks
- The corruption affected multiple files across the codebase
- Critical mistake: I never tested locally after those edits, so the errors sat hidden for days
- HuggingFace caught them immediately during deployment when Python tried to import the modules

The Struggle:
I spent hours trying manual fixes:
- Python scripts to add indentation
- sed commands to fix specific lines  
- Git restoration from old commits (but they were corrupted too!)
- Even Black formatter initially failed because the syntax was too broken to parse

The Solution:
1. Restored corrupted files from the last working deployment commit
2. Ran Black formatter on all Python files: black src/ app/
3. Black automatically fixed 10 files (653 insertions, 478 deletions)
4. Deployment successful!

Key Lessons:
✅ Always test locally before pushing - a simple python -c "import app.main" would have caught this immediately
✅ Use automated formatters like Black for Python projects
✅ Never use text manipulation tools (sed, bulk replace) on Python files
✅ Git doesn't validate syntax - your responsibility to test!
✅ Set up pre-commit hooks with Black - prevention is better than cure!

Black isn't just a code formatter - it's a lifesaver when indentation goes sideways.
